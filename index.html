Beautiful, independent, and incredibly intelligent, my two friends are both PhDs and they are both very mean, cynical, and sarcastic at the same time. I got used to being mocked at by them when I talked about my longings for marriage. But they decided they judged my IQ unfairly when I told them, <q>How are you supposed to get half of their property if you only date without getting marriage</q>.<br>

 		<em style="font-size: 36px">Freshly</em> graduated from college and just got my very first job, I am determined to be a career-wise successfuly woman. I am determined not to waste all my time on relationships that lead to nowhere as I did in the past ten years when my peers are learning new skills, doing internships, and becoming more interesting people.
